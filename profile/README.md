[GENIE](http://www.genie-mc.org) is an [international collaboration of scientists](https://hep.ph.liv.ac.uk/~costasa/genie/collaboration.html) that plays the leading role in:
 - the development of a modern and universal event generator framework and tools in support of neutrino experiments,
 - the consistent, validated and efficient implementation of a constellation of alternative physics models within a common platform,
 - the development and characterisation of novel comprehensive physics models for the simulation of neutrino and charged lepton interactions, as well as for selected BSM channels, and
 - the development of an advanced global analysis of neutrino scattering data. 

You can find more details in our [mission statement](https://hep.ph.liv.ac.uk/~costasa/genie/mission.html).

The GENIE collaboration maintains a suite of software products for the experimental neutrino community. Repositories for all products are hosted in this official GENIE GitHub organization. A list and descriptions of all public and private repositories in this GitHub organization can be found [here](Repositories.md).

Several GENIE products, including all those related with the service component of our work, such as providing an event generator platform, physics model implementations and associated tools, have source code releases with a permissive license for typical academic use. Other GENIE products, especially those coupled with our dual function of developing a proprietary global analysis of neutrino scattering data do not have source code releases, as it is common practise for several HEP global analyses. Instead, it is our analysis results (physics tunes and uncertainty assignments) which are made publicly available through our event generator platform and associated uncertainty propagation tools.
