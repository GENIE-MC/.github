        <strong>GENIE</strong> is the world’s leading neutrino event generator, 
        <strong>bridging theory and experiment in modern neutrino physics</strong>. 
        It underpins data interpretation and exploitation across major experiments. 
      </p>
      <p>
       The effort is supported by an 
       <a href="https://genie-mc.github.io/collaboration.html">international collaboration of scientists</a>.

GENIE plays the leading role in:
- the development of a modern event generation framework, including experimental interfaces and analysis-related tools in support of neutrino experiments,
- the validated and efficient implementation of a constellation of alternative physics models within a common platform,
- the development and characterisation of novel and predictive comprehensive physics models including all processes relevant from MeV to PeV energy scales, and
- the development of an advanced global analysis of neutrino scattering data for model tuning and data-driven model uncertainty evaluation.

You can find more details in our [mission statement](https://genie-mc.github.io/mission.html).

The GENIE collaboration maintains a [suite of well-known software products](https://genie-mc.github.io/products.html). All GENIE products are hosted in this official GitHub organization. [Click here for a list and brief description of all repositories](Repositories.md).

Some GENIE products—such as the event generator platform, physics models, and tools—are open-source under a permissive academic license. Others, linked to proprietary global neutrino scattering analyses, do not release source code. Instead, analysis results (tunes and uncertainties) are made available through the platform.
