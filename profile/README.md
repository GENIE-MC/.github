GENIE is an **international collaboration of scientists that plays the leading role in**:
 - the development of a modern and universal event generator framework and tools in support of neutrino experiments,
 - the consistent, validated and efficient implementation of a constellation of alternative physics models within a common platform,
 - the development and characterisation of novel comprehensive physics models for the simulation of neutrino and charged lepton interactions, as well as for selected BSM channels, and
 - the development of an advanced global analysis of neutrino scattering data. 

The GENIE collaboration maintains a suite of software products for the experimental neutrino community. All products are hosted in this GitHub organization.

## GENIE products and repositories hosted in this GitHub organization

### Generator 

GitHub repository at: https://github.com/GENIE-MC/Generator

The well-known GENIE Generator product implements a modern framework for Monte Carlo event generators and includes state-of-the-art physics modules. The GENIE physics model is universal and comprehensive: It handles all neutrinos and targets, and all processes relevant from MeV to PeV energy scales. The Generator includes several tools (flux drivers, detector geometry navigation drivers, and specialized event generation apps) to simulate complex experimental setups in full detail. The GENIE Generator is used by nearly all modern neutrino experiments and its predictions serve as standard reference points for the neutrino community. Generators for charged lepton and hadron scattering off nucleons and nuclei, as well as several generators for BSM channels of interest at neutrino experiments, are supported within a unified physics framework.

### Comparisons

GitHub repository at: https://github.com/GENIE-MC/Comparisons

The Comparisons product includes very extensive curated archives of neutrino, charged-lepton and hadron scattering data, as well as highly-developed software to produce a comprehensive set of data/MC comparisons. It includes embedded interfaces to the Professor tuning tool which "reduces the exponentially expensive process of brute-force tuning to a scaling closer to a power law in the number of parameters and allows for massive parallelisation". The Comparisons product plays a key role in comprehensive model characterization in GENIE, it underpins the GENIE global analysis, and it enabled the production of several new tunes.

## Source code releases and copyright

Several GENIE products, including all those related with the service component of our work, such as providing an event generator platform, 
physics model implementations and associated tools  have source code releases that can be found in public repositories of our official GitHub organization page. 

Other GENIE products, especially those coupled with our dual function of developing a proprietary global analysis of neutrino scattering data 
do not have source code releases, as it is common practise for several HEP global analyses. 
Instead, it is our analysis results, obtained using those closed-source products, which are made publicly available through our open-source products. 
GENIE closed-source products are hosted in private repositories of our official GitHub organization page. 

GENIE reserves all rights on the distribution, development and use of its closed-source products,
and reserves all rights on the distribution, development and use of its open-source products for the purpose of non-academic applications,
as well as for academic applications with community-wide scope (such as providing common event generation frameworks, tools and models for multiple experiments).
